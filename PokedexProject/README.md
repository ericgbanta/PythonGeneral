# Pokedex Project #
This purpose of this project was to scrape data from pokemondb.net. Utilized requests and pandas to import pokemon statistics into a JSON file.

The JSON file was then used to build a GUI that replicates a pokedex. Users can select a pokemon and hit the search button to view stats and an image of the pokemon.
